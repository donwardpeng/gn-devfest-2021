      session:"The ability to alter reality has taken a leap forward with \"DeepFake\" technology which allows for the creation of images and videos of real people saying and doing things they never said or did. Deep learning techniques are escalating the DeepFake technology\'s finesse, producing even more realistic content that is increasingly difficult to detect.<p><p>DeepFakes refers to fake media content created using Generative Adversarial Networks. DeepFake Technology does have the potential to contribute to uncertainty and distrust of media content thereby posing a significant challenge to democracy. Credible yet fraudulent audio, video, and text will have a much larger impact that can be used to ruin celebrity and brand reputations as well as influence political opinion with terrifying implications. Imagine a dark web economy where DeepFakers produce misleading content that can be released publicly to influence major decisions. DeepFakes might touch all areas of our lives, and even basic protection is essential going forward.<p><p>This talk presents robust computer vision and deep learning DeepFake detection frameworks to exploit hidden patterns and manipulated parts that play a key role in authenticating original media files. To ensure the prediction results of the deep learning framework & the origin of solutions for each prediction are interpretable, a model-agnostic explainability framework is employed. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) creates explainable models while maintaining a high level of learning performance, thereby enabling users to understand and appropriately trust the underlying models. Having explanations for each prediction helps us better understand the model as it allows visualization of the layers and filters of the networks. Thus, explainable models provide insights into deep learning models thereby improve trust in the DeepFake predictions.",

    sessionTitle: "Flutter: RenderFlex Nightmares! Rows and Columns Gone Horribly Wrong",
    session:"\"RenderFlex children have non-zero flex but incoming height constraints are unbounded\"<p><p>You aren\'t crazy. You\'re not alone. Every Flutter developer has nightmares about seeing these words in the Red Screen of Death. It's like quicksand... The more you fight the deeper you sink, and the worse it gets.<p><p>\"I'm from the government, I'm here to help.\"<p><p>The trick to understanding why this happens is to understand a few different things, and then think about them together. Flexibles, flex, FlexFit, double.infinity, and Constraints can all come together to produce a reactive UI that works beautifully or a Red Screen of Death that will haunt your nightmares. In this talk, I\'ll help you learn how to kill the RenderFlex Boogeyman, and be just like John Wick.<p><p>",
